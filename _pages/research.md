• **Peer Ability and Dynamics of Classrooms**

<details>
    <summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
    This study examines the impact of peer ability on students’ cognitive skills and academic outcomes using a unique dataset from large-scale fieldwork in Turkish primary schools. Leveraging the random assignment of students to classrooms, I find that higher peer ability significantly enhances fluid intelligence, cognitive empathy, and math and verbal test scores. These effects emerge as early as the first grade and become more pronounced by the second grade. Investigating mechanisms, I show that peer ability shapes classroom social networks by increasing ability-based homophily without affecting the quantity or quality of social ties. Furthermore, I demonstrate that classroom ability influences the learning environment as teachers adapt their pedagogical practices.

    <summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
    We investigate the impact of teachers’ intelligence on the development of children’s cognitive abilities. Our setting leverages the random assignment of first-grade students to teachers, who tend to remain their primary instructors across subjects for four years. We measure a wide range of outcomes: core cognitive functions (attention, working memory), foundational skills (numeracy, verbal ability), higher-order reasoning (abstract reasoning, analogical reasoning, analytical categorization, critical thinking), and socio-cognitive skills (cognitive empathy, norm-based reasoning). We find that teachers with high fluid intelligence substantially enhance children’s higher-order reasoning and socio-cognitive skills, alongside improvements in core cognition and literacy. We examine several potential mechanisms related to teaching style, beliefs, and attitudes. Beyond these, one striking channel emerges: teachers with higher intelligence foster denser and more cohesive classroom friendship networks, which in turn support peer-to-peer learning without reinforcing ability-based segregation. These findings demonstrate that teacher intelligence shapes the development of higher-order reasoning and socio-cognitive capacities, which are central to the formation of human and social capital.

    <summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
    In the spring of 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic swept across the globe, governments implemented drastic containment measures, including widespread school closures that deprived millions of children of their primary social environment—the classroom. To understand how the pandemic affected classroom peer relationships, we leverage social network data from 3rd and 4th-grade students in Turkish primary schools, comparing pre-pandemic and pandemic cohorts across three relationship types: friendship, academic support, and emotional support. We document opposing changes across network types: friendship isolation increased by 22%, while academic support nominations rose by 20%. These improvements in academic support were driven entirely by native students; refugee students faced deterioration in both friendship and academic support networks. Our findings show that large-scale disruptions can reshape peer relationships in complex ways, underscoring the vital role of the classroom in building social capital.
