    <summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
    In the spring of 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic swept across the globe, governments took drastic measures to curb the virus spread, including shutting down educational institutions. This sudden and unexpected closure of schools not only disrupted the education of millions of students but also deprived them of their primary social environment---the classroom. In this study, we analyze the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on classroom peer relationships using a unique field dataset collected from 3rd and 4th-grade primary school children in Turkey that includes both pre-pandemic and pandemic cohorts. Our findings reveal that the pandemic cohort undergoes significant changes in their classroom social interactions after an extended school closure, compared to the pre-pandemic cohort. We observe varying effects contingent upon the nature of peer relationships. Specifically, while friendship relationships deteriorated, certain aspects of academic support relationships among classmates showed signs of improvement. However, this progress was exclusively observed among native students, as opposed to refugees, thereby accentuating a heterogeneity in the results. Additionally, our investigation uncovers significant improvements in inter-ethnicity and inter-gender relationships in classrooms after COVID-19.
